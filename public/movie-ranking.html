<h1>The Bet Series According to Psalmwell</h1>
<h2>The Top 3 Series of all-Time</h2>

<hr />
<h3>1. Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>
  This is my favorite because of the plot, thrill, storyline, casting and a
  whole lot more
</p>
<h3>2. The Originals</h3>
<p>
  This is just almost as perfect as The Game of Thrones with a lot of emotions
  thrown into it.
</p>
<h3>3. Suits</h3>
<p>No words can describe the intelectual thrill of this movie.</p>
